//this is a fancy way to document new things i learn while building this project

Jul 1
finished db integration and schema design
i should create a branch and start building CRUD operations for workspaces 

and this is how we do it:
git fetch origin
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b feature/workspace-crud

NOTE: include prisma generate in you build script

creating endpoints to for workspace and learned you need to create these piece of shits for api response:
export interface ApiSuccess<T> {
  success: true;
  data: T;
}

export interface ApiError {
  success: false;
  error: {
    message: string;
    code?: number;
  };
}
